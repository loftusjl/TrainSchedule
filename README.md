# TrainSchedule

Tracks trains entered and shows when the next train is scheduled to arrive.

## Getting Started

Enter your trains with the Train Name, Destination, First Train Time (in military time), and Frequency -- in minutes.
The scheduler will keep track of when the trains are due to arrive and alert you about which should be showing up next in relative time.
